## Description

Please explain your thoughts clearly and concisely. The following three-paragraph format is preferred.

1. State the general issue in 1-2 matter-of-fact high-level sentences.
2. Explain supporting context and details necessary to understand paragraph 1.
3. Suggest solutions, implementation details, or other ideas if you have them.

Then, if applicable, write a minimal example in R code or pseudo-code to show input, usage, and desired output.

To help us read any code you include (optional) please try to follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The `style_text()` and `style_file()` functions from the [`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package make it easier.
