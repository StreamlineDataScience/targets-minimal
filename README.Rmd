# Bayesian model validation with the `targets` package

The goal of this workflow is to validate a small Bayesian hierarchical model.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
y_i ~ iid Normal(alpha + x_i * beta, sigma^2)
alpha ~ Normal(0, 1)
beta ~ Normal(0, 1)
sigma ~ Uniform(0, 1)
```

We simulate multiple datasets from the model and fit the model on each dataset. For each model fit, we determine if the 50% credible interval of the regression coefficient `beta` contains the true value of `beta` used to generate the data. If we implemented the model correctly, roughly 50% of the models should recapture the true `beta` in 50% credible intervals.

## The `targets` pipeline

The [`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) R package manages the workflow. It automatically skips steps of the pipeline when the results are already up to date, which is critical for Bayesian data analysis because it usually takes a long time to run Markov chain Monte Carlo. It also helps users understand and communicate this work with tools like the interactive dependency graph below.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(targets)
tar_visnetwork()
```

## File structure

The files in this example are organized as follows.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
├── run.sh
├── run.R
├── _targets.R
├── sge.tmpl
├── R/
├──── functions.R
├── stan/
└──── model.stan
```

File | Purpose
---|---
`run.sh` | Shell script to run `run.R` in a persistent background process. Works on Unix-like systems. Helpful for long computations on servers.
`run.R` | R script to run `tar_make()` or `tar_make_clustermq()` (uncomment the function of your choice.)
`_targets.R` | The special R script that declares the [`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) pipeline. See `tar_script()` for details.
`sge.tmpl` | A [`clustermq`](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq) template file to deploy targets in parallel to a Sun Grid Engine cluster.
`R/functions.R` | An R script with user-defined functions. Unlike `_targets.R`, there is nothing special about the name or location of this script. In fact, for larger projects, it is good practice to partition functions into multiple files.
`stan/model.stan` | The specification of our Stan model.

## How to run

1. Install the [`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) package, as well as the packages listed in the `tar_options()` call in `_targets.R`.
1. Run the `targets` pipeline by either running `run.R` or `run.sh`. (The latter is for Unix-like systems only). This computation could take a while.
1. View the validation results in the output `report.html` file.
1. Make changes to the R code or Stan model, rerun the pipeline, and watch `targets` skip steps that are already up to date.

## Scale out

This computation is currently downsized for pedagogical purposes. To scale it up, open the `_targets.R` script and increase the number of simulations (the number inside `seq_len()` in the `index` target).

## High-performance computing

You can run this project locally on your laptop or remotely on a cluster. You have several choices, and they each require modifications to `run.R` and `_targets.R`.

Mode | When to use | Instructions for `run.R` | Instructions for `_targets.R`
---|---|---|---
Sequential | Low-spec local machine or Windows. | Uncomment `tar_make()` | No action required.
Local multicore | Local machine with a Unix-like OS. | Uncomment `tar_make_clustermq()` | Uncomment `options(clustermq.scheduler = "multicore")`
Sun Grid Engine | Sun Grid Engine cluster. | Uncomment `tar_make_clustermq()` | Uncomment `options(clustermq.scheduler = "sge", clustermq.template = "sge.tmpl")`
