This report contains the results of a minimal `targets` data analysis pipeline. We reference our targets with `tar_load()` and `tar_read()`. This ensures

1. Because of the `tar_knitr()` call (see `_targets.R`) `targets` automatically detects the dependencies of this report and rebuilds it when its dependencies change.
1. We can run the report by itself if the targets are already in the `_targets/` data store.

Here is our fitted regression model of ozone versus wind and temperature.

```{r}
tar_read(fit)
```

Here is our histogram of ozone content.

```{r}
library(targets)
tar_load(hist)
hist
```
